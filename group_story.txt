“I had breakfast on the terrace. At 2 pm I had a doctor's appointment and I was back at 11 pm, after meeting some schoolmates at Joan's. It was supposed to be at Laura's but
they changed their mind at the last minute. I missed the bus so I had to walk 4 blocks to the nearest metro station. I had lunch with
David at 12 and headed to the beach at 6 pm after finishing my work day.”
